* 20240823: Creation, maintenance and deletion of workload-clusters now has
  moved to [this project](https://gitlab.com/22e88/cluster-api-workload-cluster)
  That way it is easier and faster to develop and test features in each area.
  The workload-cluster project uses the latest management cluster which has
  been created in the management-cluster project. It does this by downloading
  an artifact from the management-cluster project, which holds the required 
  information how to reach that management-cluster (currently Ansible inventory
  file) 
* 20240816: There was a problem in storing the HCloud token as a secret in the KinD
  management cluster node. This is fixed in v0.0.4 (main), in dev and stage
  even earlier.
